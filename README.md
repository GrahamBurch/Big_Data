# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Overview
* This analysis investigates MechaCar's car production data for potentially useful insights. We aim to isolate the particular variables most predictive of miles per gallon performance. 

## Linear Regression
* Spoiler weight, vehicle angle and AWD (all-wheel drive) contributed to non-random variances in the model. Ground clearance and vehicle length were the two most significant variables.
